You can use this code for your own websites with credits. Please don't hesitate to ask me if any doubt.

I love keep it open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. I spent a non-negligible amount of effort developing, designing, and trying to perfect this website, and I am proud of it! All I ask is to not claim this effort as your own.
